      title: "Common College Moving Problems We Solve",
      content:
        "College moves come with unique challenges that most moving companies aren't equipped to handle. We deal with them every day. Common problems we solve include tight budgets and limited funds for professional help, moving into dorm rooms with narrow hallways, elevators, and shared common areas, limited parking and strict campus loading zone rules, move-in day chaos with hundreds of families arriving at once, last-minute schedule changes or delayed housing assignments, moving between semesters with tight timelines, transporting mini-fridges, futons, desks, and awkwardly shaped furniture, needing help when parents can't visit or friends aren't available, and coordinating moves around class schedules and academic calendars. Our crews understand campus logistics and can adapt quickly to the fast-paced, unpredictable environment of student housing."
